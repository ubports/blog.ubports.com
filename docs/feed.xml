        <title>Core Apps, Backup Script, and a New Website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our latest Community Update was on June 24, 2017. If you’d like to watch the video version, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BoiGoXrVCo&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These sessions typically occur every two weeks at 1800 UTC so come along next time if you have a question. You can also catch up on previous ones on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGJ7jdEoOx6_o_GbkjFaBg&quot;&gt;our youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks have already passed since our last Q&amp;amp;A and a huge amount of behind-the-scenes work here at UBports. Whilst many of the behind-the-scenes updates listed below are not immediate in their impact they are all critical not just for sustaining existing progress but also for the eventual development of new builds for new devices. Some developments like those of of Halium and Core Apps, although currently invisible, will lead to a much smoother, better mobile operating system in the future. We’re pleased with the progress and excited to share it with you below along with updates from Halium, Core Apps Update, Backup Script for devices, Ubuntu 16.04, our new website, sponsor news and updates about the UBports Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, as usual, we are honoured to take a moment to thank all of our sponsors. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/ubports&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; (public voluntary donations)  reached $1800 per month today - a staggering amount for a project that was just a ‘garage band’ three months ago. Thank you all for voting and encouraging with your wallet, telling us that our mission is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we’ve been discussing what we could do with the revenues beyond paying developers. One idea being considered is having an “app dev” fund where we buy and ship budding developers a device to help them make their app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also like to thank our largest sponsor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://smoose.nl&quot;&gt;Smoose&lt;/a&gt;. Smoose is a Dutch IT services company focused on making the workplace more open (source). They’ve made a lot of our work in the past year possible by distributing phones to developers, sending us to events (MWC was really cool!), and generally offering support wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halium-71&quot;&gt;Halium 7.1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halium is one of the fastest-moving projects that the alternative mobile OS community has seen lately. Halium is a common platform for running GNU/Linux distributions on Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started just two months ago with “Hey, all of our projects use the same library and we should make it standard.” Now, it is to a point where it is able to boot Ubuntu Touch 16.04 and Plasma Mobile on devices with Android 5.1. Today, Marius announced another huge leap for the project: budding Android 7.1 support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for Halium 7.1 has been released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Halium/android/tree/halium-7.1&quot;&gt;Halium’s GitHub organization&lt;/a&gt;. It is to a point where developers can build it and flash it to a device with ADB debugging. Most hardware isn’t working yet, but getting to the debugging point is an important first step for Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More info about Halium can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://halium.org/&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people have noticed that we’ve been pouring a lot of development time into Halium rather than the Ubuntu Touch system itself. This is because we need a stable system underneath Ubuntu Touch before we’re able to continue developing it. When debugging software, it’s important to know that you’re going to get the same results every time you run it. Halium gives us this peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-apps&quot;&gt;Core Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of our community members who have been contributing to the Ubuntu Touch core apps. These are those apps that were mostly originally developed by Canonical or partners, but still need updating to keep them running smoothly and securely. There have been many pull requests sent applying to the Gallery, Clock, and Keyboard with many more coming in daily so the promise of updates and fixes for the future is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the (still unreleased) changes include:
    The Gallery app allows you to zoom in further to your photos
    The Clock app has some UI tweaks (it also nuked its automated build environment, which was fun.)
    Lots of translation improvements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been focusing more of our concerns on localization. Ubuntu Touch must be made as accessible as possible to people around the world, in their native languages. Canonical was able to use Launchpad to perform translation, but we don’t have that hooked up quite yet. If you have any suggestions or input on software that makes your life as a translator easier, let us know in &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/386/localization-software-evaluations&quot;&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also looking at ways to set up our build server so it becomes even more automatic using Jenkins pipelines. These will automatically build any pull requests that you send in to our GitHub app repositories, enabling us to make faster and more useful decisions on merging code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a prime example of the free and open software community really stepping up to further a project that they care about. We appreciate your support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backup-script&quot;&gt;Backup Script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florian (@flohack) has written an excellent little script that helps you back up and restore the data on your phone. This will be really handy if you’re switching from the Canonical build to the UBports one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware, some system settings like saved Wi-Fi networks are not backed up. We also don’t back up the apps that you have installed, you will need to grab those again under the new install. We don’t have an exact list of what you’ll since it isn’t really clear where UT stores all of its settings, or how to restore them. A good rule of thumb is that you’ll keep all of your data, keep most of your app settings, lose your system settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script has been integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mariusquabeck/magic-device-tool&quot;&gt;Marius Quabeck’s magic-device-tool&lt;/a&gt;. We’d love if you tried it out on your non-main device and gave us your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marius-talks-about-1604-for-a-while&quot;&gt;Marius talks about 16.04 for a while&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work is happening on the low-level bugs in the 16.04 version of Ubuntu Touch. These are bugs that prevent us from releasing any 16.04 images to the community. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-new-website&quot;&gt;Our New Website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smoose.nl/&quot;&gt;Smoose&lt;/a&gt;, the main sponsor of UBports for some time, promised to give us a new website while we were at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. This week, they delivered on that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new website, based on Odoo, looks and works better than anything we’ve ever had. We love it and we hope that you do too. If you have feedback, our marketing team would appreciate it. You can fill out the feedback form &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/survey/start/website-feedback-needed-4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangentally, our marketing team is working on putting all of our social media accounts in one feed so they can answer questions faster. They also created an account on Diaspora* (ubports@diasp.ca).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-discussion&quot;&gt;Security Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received a forum post recently asking how we are handling security. Generally speaking, this is how we are protecting your phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System images are GPG signed and verified on your device. You can learn more about this process &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ImageBasedUpgrades/GPG&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
Apps in the OpenStore go under manual review if they request a certain set of permissions. This means that a real person looks over the app to make sure it’s safe before anyone can ever download it. You can read more about the submission and review process at &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.uappexplorer.com/submit&quot;&gt;the OpenStore’s Submit page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubports-foundation&quot;&gt;UBports Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the big news that we were teasing everyone about leading up to the Q&amp;amp;A. It has finally gotten to a point where we are ready to make the announcement ‘official’ in the most basic sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, UBports project presents… The UBports Foundation! (&lt;em&gt;Insert symphonic hit and crowd cheering sounds here&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBports Foundation is a German non-profit entity (stiftung)created with the purpose of furthering the Ubuntu Touch platform. The way that this entity achieves this goal is to be decided by its board, but in general it will allow UBports to perform the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect money (Tax deductible for all you Europeans!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negotiate contracts as a legal entity (This will make more sense as time goes on)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide transparency of usage of funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide transparency in decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community contributors will be able to apply to become voting members of the Foundation, and be able to democratically elect the Board of Directors. The application process isn’t going to be 100% painless (sorry to drive-by contributors). We’ll go with 90% painless. We’re taking the project seriously and we want the team to do so as well. Therefore, we must have some processes and audits in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we aren’t comfortable sharing the Foundation’s founding documents quite yet as they have information about sponsorships and agreements that aren’t fully settled. Stay tuned and we’ll bring all of this to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-questions&quot;&gt;Community Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we took some questions from live chat and things we’ve been seeing around the community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;for-app-development-should-i-learn-qml-or-c&quot;&gt;For app development, should I learn QML or C++?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should learn both. QML is good for some things, but C++ really pulls the language together on the Ubuntu Touch platform. There are also some Python bindings found in PyOtherSide that can make development easier if you know Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-you-make-apps-that-run-on-plasma-mobile-sailfish-and-ut&quot;&gt;Can you make apps that run on Plasma Mobile, sailfish and UT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plasma Mobile runs UT apps. It shouldn’t be too hard to go the other way. Sailfish, on the other hand, has some pretty custom things in their OS (not to say that Ubuntu Touch does not) that cause some problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if that wasn’t wishy-washy enough for you, the answer for Sailfish apps is an honest “We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-you-port-to-the-oneplus-3-and-oneplus-5&quot;&gt;Will you port to the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 5?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a funny question to receive during live chat after we had just said “We’re not porting to new devices” earlier in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the answer probably isn’t quite what you expect. The OnePlus 5 has become one of Halium’s unofficial official testing devices for Halium 7.1, so… yes. We will have Ubuntu Touch on the OnePlus 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, OnePlus 3 was also used to test Halium 7.1, This was used before OnePlus 5 was released as an debug device, so expect this device also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When will it be released?  “It’ll be released when it’s ready.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hey-you-have-bugs-in-your-bug-trackers-for-1504-will-you-fix-them&quot;&gt;Hey! You have bugs in your bug trackers for 15.04! Will you fix them?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends. We’re balancing our time between 15.04 bugfixes and 16.04 bringup. 15.04 is such a buggy and unsupported platform that we’d really love to run from it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone with the Legacy devices, we’re keeping the lights on for you. We’re not going to make your experience perfect, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangentially, we’d really love for some UI/UX designers to join our team. Drop us a line if you’ve got great ideas for the platform!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-is-the-tablet-os-going&quot;&gt;How is the tablet OS going?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OS is the same between phones and tablets. Progress on one side is progress on the other. Convergence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-should-fix-the-long-boot-time-bug-on-the-m10-fhd&quot;&gt;You should fix the long boot-time bug on the M10 FHD.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a developer that is willing to dedicate the time to tracking down and fixing that bug. At the moment, it rates pretty low on our list of priorities. The long boot time is inconvenient when you need to reboot your tablet, but it isn’t experience-shattering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-arent-all-devices-getting-1604&quot;&gt;Why aren’t all devices getting 16.04?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few reasons:
    Some of the old official devices are too low-end and can’t show off the Ubuntu Touch platform. Would you rather show off your favorite GNU/Linux distribution running on a sleek, new computer or a 2007 one? Which will get you a better crowd response?
    All of the old official devices are closed-source so we can’t fix hardware enablement issues
    16.04 requires Linux kernel 3.10 at a minimum to function
    We don’t have the resources to support all of these devices, especially considering the manufacturer of their chipset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to maintain these devices into the 16.04 transition, we will support you as much as we can. We can’t guarantee that the work will be fruitful, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for this week! We hope you enjoyed our action-packed Update as much as we did. We’ll see you for the next one on July 8, 2017 at 1800 UTC!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stable OTA-1, Halium is Heating up, Convergence Works!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/g3bIrfqmMek&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017/06/14-Convergence.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Touch 16.04 in Windowed Mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been another great couple of weeks, and we had a lot of news to tell you all about during our &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/g3bIrfqmMek&quot;&gt;latest Community Update&lt;/a&gt;! Read on to discover all of the juicy details!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you-to-patreons-and-sponsors&quot;&gt;Thank you to Patreons and Sponsors!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to take a bit of time to thank all of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/ubports&quot;&gt;Patrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/sponsors&quot;&gt;sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. You are all proving to us that what we do is important and useful to the wider community. Thanks for sharing the ride with us. If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-news&quot;&gt;The News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-ota-1-is-shipping-except-the-nexus-4&quot;&gt;Stable OTA-1 is shipping! (except the Nexus 4)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBports project is proud to announce Stable OTA-1 for all of our officially supported devices, minus the Nexus 5 (hammerhead) and Nexus 4 (mako).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the most exciting news for us. OTA-1 is the culmination of our efforts over the past two months. It brings many bug fixes and enhancements to the platform, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimental AGPS support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The UBports Welcome app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The amazing OpenStore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terminal and File Browser are preinstalled (It’s the little things!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bug fixes for the UBports ported devices. You can see a list of bugs targeted and closed for this release &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-touch/milestone/1?closed=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nexus 4 is being brought up separately from the rest of the devices and its OTA-1 release will be announced when it is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (June 18)&lt;/strong&gt;: The update for the Nexus 5 has beeen released! Now all of you Nexus 5 owners can flash Stable images as well! Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://devices.ubports.com/#/hammerhead&quot;&gt;Our Devices website&lt;/a&gt; or download &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer/releases&quot;&gt;The UBports installer beta&lt;/a&gt; to flash your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;osapp-developer-meeting&quot;&gt;OS/App Developer Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 1st, we invited about 20 Ubuntu Touch App and Platform developers to a meeting where we discussed how we can do things better in the future. A lot came out of this meeting and we’d love to discuss all of it here, but there’s a much better write-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/273/june-1-2017-app-developer-os-developer-meeting/14&quot;&gt;in our forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were some of the big discussion points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Snaps may be a good addition to the platform, but we’ll need to make modifications to snapd before we can use them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To service notifications in the future while improving user privacy, we will implement “headless apps”. The OS will call these every few minutes and allow them to do some work in the background such as check for messages. This will be done with battery savings and user control in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We would really like to have the newest features in Qt 5.9 available to us, such as QtQuick 2. This will require Yunit to be built with Qt 5.9, which was not officially packaged in 16.04 at the time of the meeting. More discussions are happening on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halium-is-moving-quickly&quot;&gt;Halium is Moving Quickly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halium, as you may know, is a project aiming to standardize the Android hardware compatibility layer between many Linux distributions. This layer is required because Android drivers can’t be used natively in a regular Linux distribution. This week the project had a lot to show off - it can boot both Ubuntu Touch and Plasma Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HaliumProject/status/871592584136622081&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Halium can boot both OS’s on the Nexus 5. The third image, though, is the most interesting. It shows Plasma Mobile booting on the Fairphone 2, a phone that the OS hasn’t been explicitly ported to. It’s easy to see the opportunities that Halium opens up and we’re proud to be a part of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-have-a-public-roadmap&quot;&gt;We have a Public Roadmap!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s still a work in progress, but you can see the goals that we’re setting for every release on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-touch/milestones&quot;&gt;our ubports-touch milestone tracker&lt;/a&gt;. This lets the community see what we’re targeting to cut a release. The 16.04 milestones are still filling up with enhancements, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marius-showed-off-convergence&quot;&gt;Marius showed off Convergence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in the update, Marius took out his trusty Nexus 5 and Slimport cable to show off convergence. It’s a little difficult to see his screen, but you can find this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/g3bIrfqmMek?t=38m0s&quot;&gt;38:00&lt;/a&gt; in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions-and-answers&quot;&gt;Questions and Answers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of our news out of the way, we began taking questions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-the-branding-staying-the-same-will-we-keep-the-ubuntu-touch-and-ubports-name&quot;&gt;Is the branding staying the same? Will we keep the Ubuntu Touch and UBports name?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re carefully weighing our options on changing the name. We have nothing more to say on this topic right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-will-happen-to-the-nexus-7-2013-wifi-flo&quot;&gt;What will happen to the Nexus 7 2013 WiFi (flo)?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a device that Canonical provided an image for, but we don’t yet have one available. We do not have a test device available. Also, our developers have a lot of projects going on right now. If you’d like to try porting Ubuntu Touch to this device yourself (and don’t want to wait for Halium and 16.04-based images), please check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-you-make-a-guide-that-makes-it-easier-for-people-to-choose-a-channel-to-flash&quot;&gt;Can you make a guide that makes it easier for people to choose a channel to flash?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Release-Channels&quot;&gt;Sure we can!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-happening-in-our-collaboration-with-yunit&quot;&gt;What’s happening in our collaboration with Yunit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yunit is &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.yunit.io/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;p=215#p215&quot;&gt;working on backporting its stack to 16.04&lt;/a&gt; since it’s only running on Debian Unstable and Ubuntu right now. That’ll be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-status-of-the-switch-to-ubports-script&quot;&gt;What’s the status of the switch to UBports script?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just a proof-of-concept for now, but if you want to try it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mariogrip/switch-to-ubports&quot;&gt;knock yourself out&lt;/a&gt;. It might be integrated into the UBports installer in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-googles-project-treble-do-for-ubports-and-halium&quot;&gt;What does Google’s Project Treble do for UBports and Halium?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google recently announced “a modular base for Android” to solve the problem of having to backport Android updates to every device seperately. While Treble does sound similar to Haliums approach, it doesn’t eliminate the need for Libhybris, the translation library for Android’s bionic drivers. It remains to be seen if this project will change our life for the better, but since it’s just been announced, we can just continue what we’re doing at the moment for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-happening-with-anbox&quot;&gt;What’s happening with Anbox?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We definitely want Android App compatibility, but it is not our highest priority for the moment. Since there’s so much to be done, it will also probably not land for 15.04, but we’re looking forward to playing around with it on the soon-to-come 16.04 images. It is important to point out here, that we still need top push for native apps. Anbox will just be a way of getting crucial android apps that don’t exist on Ubuntu Touch otherwise to run, similar to Wine on the Linux Desktop. The experience will probably not be the same, but it will help eliminate the immediate need. Apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat or Netflix will probably not be ported to Ubuntu Touch, so it makes sense to run them in Anbox if it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-anbox-needed-cant-you-just-use-dalvik-from-the-android-container&quot;&gt;Why is Anbox needed? Can’t you just use Dalvik from the Android container?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that simple. This would require us to build compatibility with the Mir display server and all of the userland, it doesn’t work like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;we don’t want to be android!&lt;/strong&gt; We want Ubuntu Touch to be a GNU/Linux distribution for mobile devices, the Android container is just the way for us to get hardware access and we don’t want features to depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-first-feature-you-will-add-to-ubuntu-touch&quot;&gt;What’s the first feature you will add to Ubuntu Touch?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we already archieved a lot. Agps, bug fixes, minor UI improvements, updates on the core apps, etc. A big jump will be of course the transition to 16.04 and with it the upcoming snap support, but if you’re looking for features from a user perspective, it will probably be Anbox and .apk support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-it-possible-to-use-the-ubuntu-ui-toolkit-on-1704-to-develop-apps&quot;&gt;Is it possible to use the Ubuntu UI toolkit on 17.04 to develop apps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not right now, and we don’t have the resources to make it work right away. If you don’t want to use 16.04, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Set-up-a-Clickable-working-environment-inside-an-LXC-container&quot;&gt;run it inside an LXD container&lt;/a&gt; to create your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-ubports-ever-come-to-closed-source-devices&quot;&gt;Will UBports ever come to closed-source devices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. The device tree needs to be open-source, so the porters can see what’s happening underneath. Ubuntu Touch on the iPhone is not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calls-for-help&quot;&gt;Calls for Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always get people asking “How can I help you guys out?” Well, here are a few things that we’d really appreciate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>AGPS, App Updates, Halium, and more!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/517OFPd_VTI&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://devblog.ubports.com/assets/2017/06/01-xenial-halium.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu 16.04 running inside Halium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our latest Community Update and Q&amp;amp;A on May 27th. You can watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/517OFPd_VTI&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There were lots of news stories and questions to go through, so we’d better start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-news&quot;&gt;The News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been loads happening with UBports the past two weeks. We’ve landed new features, gained new sponsors, and seen lots of work by lots of people in our growing community. It is worth remembering that is still just 2 months since the news came of Canonical moving away from Unity and Ubuntu Touch and now we are seeing more activity on Ubuntu Touch than for a very long time and that is really encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;patreon-hit-1500&quot;&gt;Patreon hit $1500&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, we have a lot of Patrons to thank. You all make UBports possible, month after month. As a direct result of your support…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marius-gripsgard-began-working-full-time&quot;&gt;Marius Gripsgard began working full time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting this week, Marius is working on UBports full time which will have an enormous impact on our project! We’re taking advantage of this opportunity to plan vital meetings to help progress our growing OS and plan its future using the core teams and long-term Ubuntu app developers. All meetings will be written up and the notes will be shared with the community to keep everyone in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubports-gains-a-sponsor&quot;&gt;UBports Gains a sponsor!!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were overjoyed and surprised when Private Internet Access (https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) contacted us offering their sponsorship. We’re still reeling that such a huge name in privacy services was willing to put money on the table and tell us that they like what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using the funds from their sponsorship to target directly our priorities with Ubuntu Touch and raise bounties to get developers involved with providing fixes. We’ll be deciding these priorities for instance in some of our upcoming meetings. Stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-devices-that-were-sold-with-ubuntu-for-devices-can-now-run-ubports-builds&quot;&gt;All devices that were sold with Ubuntu for Devices can now run UBports’ builds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every official Canonical Ubuntu Touch  device (except the devices that needed to be flashed by users, like the Nexus 4 and 7 2013 WiFi) are now  working with UBports Ubuntu Touch images. This is great news for everyone that was initially worried by Canonical’s decision. The image for the Nexus 4 is still under development and we currently don’t have a test device for the Nexus 7, but we will hopefully get there soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to try out the UBports images, the please check out how on our wiki (https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/How-to-flash-existing-ubuntu-touch-devices-with-Ubports-images). There is information on backing up your phone and flashing it with the UBports images (the process will wipe your device’s data, so be aware and warned!). We will next create a script that will flash your phone  without data loss so you may wish to wait until that is completed. You can follow progress on this script &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mariogrip/switch-to-ubports/blob/master/switch-to-ubports.sh&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. This is great news for UBports as in less than 2 months we can boast that our devices we support have grown from 3 key devices (Nexus 5, OnePlus One and Fairphone 2) to 13!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agps-mozilla-location-service&quot;&gt;AGPS Mozilla Location Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, we can’t use HERE Maps Assisted GPS included in official Canonical images. Assisted GPS (AGPS) is a system that allows a device determine its location by triangulating the distances to different cellphone towers and WiFi base stations. This method is a lot faster than GPS and can be combined to a very reliable positioning system. We are currently testing our very own implementation of the Mozilla Location Service on Ubuntu Touch! Good job, devs! Again another first for Ubuntu Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-channels&quot;&gt;New channels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are moving to a six-channel system, three for 15.04 (containing the so-called legacy images based on Ubuntu 15.04) and three for 16.04 (not live yet, will contain images for the core devices based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). Inside these categories there will then be called  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;devel&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration&quot;&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; builds that are automatically pulled from GitHub; these are prone to be very unstable), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt; (release candidates that are manually promoted from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;devel&lt;/code&gt; channel after successful testing; fairly stable) and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; (official releases; as stable as possible). This system will allow us for easier quality assurance and a smooth transition to the new base for the core devices. So 3 channels for 15:04 and 3 for 16:04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For daily driver use, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; channel is recommended, but we are planning to publish OTA updates more regularly than Canonical used to provide them to ensure all users get the new features and fixes as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bug-reporting-moved-to-github&quot;&gt;Bug reporting moved to GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You spoke and we listened: Launchpad is a powerful tool, but it’s far from being user friendly, so Jan moved &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-touch/issues&quot;&gt;all the bug reports to GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in reporting bugs or filing enhancement-proposals, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Writing-a-Good-Bug-Report&quot;&gt;this handy guide&lt;/a&gt; that Dalton wrote. You can also track the progress of development on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-touch/projects/&quot;&gt;Kanban Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will probably still use Launchpad for Translations when we get around to it but that has not been set up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halium-is-coming-along-nicely&quot;&gt;Halium is coming along nicely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marius and Bhushan made some great progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://halium.org&quot;&gt;Halium&lt;/a&gt;. It is now able to boot Ubuntu 16.04 with a basic Android container (see the image above)! Before anyone gets too exited, though, we need to be clear that we still have to complete a lot of work before it’s ready to install on consumer devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things are already working, though. Most importantly, adb and ssh can be used for debugging. Mir, WiFi, Bluetooth, sound and voice calling are already functional, so we might see some builds on the 16.04 development channel soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backup-and-restore-script&quot;&gt;Backup and restore script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are afraid of reflashing their device to UBports as they fear losing their data, so Florian has kindly been working on making backing up Ubuntu Touch installations easier. It will be integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool&quot;&gt;Magic Device Tool&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not thoroughly tested yet so again watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dekko-is-back&quot;&gt;Dekko is back!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Chapman announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/228/dekko-as-click/14&quot;&gt;he will continue his work on the Dekko E-Mail client&lt;/a&gt; on Ubuntu Touch! Due to the imminent deprecation of Click packages under Canonical, he stopped his work on the click version a few months back to focus development on a snap version using a different version of Qt. But the huge community interest in Ubuntu Touch we’ve seen over the last two months has motivated him to bring Dekko back to the OpenStore so that it will even run on Legacy Devices. This is excellent news for any Ubuntu Touch user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will still need some time to iron out the remaining issues, but we can really speak for the whole community when we say &lt;strong&gt;thank you Dan!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rehosting-core-apps&quot;&gt;Rehosting Core-Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking to bring the core apps to the OpenStore, but we need maintainers for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We announced earlier that the App-Dev team has been looking into rebasing the Telegram App to Cutegram. As it tuns out, this is not that easy, so the team will instead continue to work on the current stack. Supergroups are still a work in progress, but two-factor-authentication is now working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubports-installer-and-magic-device-tool-gui&quot;&gt;UBports Installer and magic-device-tool GUI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon there will be two GUI methods to flash your phone with Ubuntu Touch: The UBports Installer and Magic Device Tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBports Installer offers a simple experience: plug in your device, start the tool, pick your channel, and press Go. The installer is not ready for use yet, but its &lt;strong&gt;prerelease&lt;/strong&gt; code can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The target platforms are MacOS and Windows, though it also works on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/517OFPd_VTI?t=1778&quot;&gt;Check out the video for a live demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marius Quabeck’s Magic-Device-Tool, on the other hand, is a powerhouse in disguise. It allows you to install many different operating systems on your phone with a few simple steps. The team behind the script is working on a Qt-based GUI to make flashing even easier. For now, you can download the script &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool&quot;&gt;from GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or install the snap using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo snap install magic-device-tool --devmode&lt;/code&gt; (make sure to read the GitHub README!). Please ask in the MDT telegram group if you have any questions or need support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubports-in-the-media&quot;&gt;UBports in the media&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from all the articles being published about UBports around the web, some team members have been interviewed on various shows and podcasts in the last couple of weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marius Gripsgard (@mariogrip) and Bhushan Shah (@bshah) about Halium &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Sp-K-0NROf4&quot;&gt;on the Luduke Hour&lt;/a&gt; (English)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian Douglass (@bhdouglass) about uAppExplorer and the OpenStore &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubuntupodcast.org/2017/05/26/s10e12-needy-expensive-spiders/&quot;&gt;on the Ubuntu Podcast&lt;/a&gt; (English)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jan Sprinz (@NeoTheThird) about UBports in general &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubuntufun.de/2017/05/ubuntufun-podcast-folge-35-was-gibts-neues-bei-ubports/&quot;&gt;on the UbuntuFun.de Podcast&lt;/a&gt; (German)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marcos Costales (developer of uNav) about uNav &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/41IUhcPJgrk&quot;&gt;on Ubuntu y otras hierbas&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loquiim-needs-your-help&quot;&gt;LoquiIM needs your help!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openstore.ubports.com/app/loquiim.nfsprodriver&quot;&gt;LoquiIM&lt;/a&gt; is a third party WhatsApp client for Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch. Unfortunately the protocol and API the app uses will be deprecated next month, so the team needs help with the move to the new protocol. If you want to help with the move to the noise protocol, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/loqui/im&quot;&gt;their GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-lets-take-some-questions&quot;&gt;Now let’s take some questions!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-ubports-support-multirom&quot;&gt;Will UBports support Multirom?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. We haven’t played with MultiROM in over a year and it would be too much work to fix it right now, so if you have MultiROM and you want Ubuntu Touch, you will have to choose one OS. That &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; change with Halium, but that’s not carved in stone yet and we won’t make any promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone in the community wants to maintain it, we will obviously support that, but we won’t put any work into it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-future-of-x11-apps-on-ubuntu-touch&quot;&gt;What’s the future of X11-apps on Ubuntu Touch?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still possible to install desktop Linux apps on Ubuntu Touch using a Libertine container. It’s not a very smooth experience, so we did not preinstall desktop apps in our images. If you’re interested in playing with Libertine, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/262/desktop-apps/2&quot;&gt;follow this guide&lt;/a&gt; a user wrote on our forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 16.04, we definitely want to make installing X11 and Wayland apps simple and easy, but that’s still looking to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-status-of-mir-on-top-of-wayland&quot;&gt;What’s the status of Mir on top of Wayland?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on who you ask. If you ask a user, the platform is completely unusable. If you ask a developer, most of the stuff is already there. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/mir/commit/a8cd1fcc1eb15c45297b2181fc93a3503aa69150&quot;&gt;is all developed in public&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s in a very early stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-cant-i-just-apt-get-install-something&quot;&gt;Why can’t i just apt-get install something?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is possible to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; on the device if the filesystem is made writable. That’s not recommended for most users since it’s easy to break the system doing that. Unlike most desktop Linux distributions, we are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ImageBasedUpgrades/&quot;&gt;image-based upgrades&lt;/a&gt; to update the system. That means that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/How-a-UBports-Image-is-Built&quot;&gt;root-filesystem and all the packages are put together by us&lt;/a&gt; and delivered to the device in one piece. This method allows for a lot faster updates than just running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt; on the device, if you ever updated a Raspberry Pi, you know what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking into making this process safe, easy and noob-friendly without taking away any hacker functionality in the future. *cough* Snappy *cough*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-you-thought-about-asking-canonical-to-ask-the-developers-to-move-their-apps-to-the-openstore&quot;&gt;Have you thought about asking Canonical to ask the developers to move their apps to the OpenStore?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would probably not do that. We already talked to a lot of developers and most actively maintained apps have been moved, so there’s also not really a need for that. If you find an app in the Click Store that you would like to see in the OpenStore, try and get ahold of the developer yourself and ask them if they would be up to move their app themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-make-an-app&quot;&gt;How do I make an App?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App development on Ubuntu Touch is diffcult. The Ubuntu SDK is very broken and we are understaffed to fix it for the moment. Still there are some developers on the forum, that are always happy to help newbies solve problems. Also worth mentioning are &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/184/ubuntu-touch-programming-course&quot;&gt;the app development guide&lt;/a&gt; written by Mimecar,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Set-up-a-Clickable-working-environment-inside-an-LXC-container&quot;&gt;Clickable&lt;/a&gt; from Brian Douglass and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/&quot;&gt;the canonical documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most Apps are open source anyways, you can also try and take a look at their source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-next-patreon-goal&quot;&gt;What’s the next patreon goal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of depends on what the community wants to see. We are thinking about additional financial support for Anbox and Halium, but that’s yet to be decided. Feel free to share your feedback in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-up-with-the-ubuntu-touch-emulator&quot;&gt;What’s up with the Ubuntu Touch emulator?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emulator has been broken for a while and it’s not our highest priority to fix it at the moment. To fix it, our HAL would have to be ported to the Goldfish device, so it might make more sense to wait for Halium before fixing it. Maybe someone in the community wants to pick it up before then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-it&quot;&gt;That’s it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have questions that haven’t been answered yet? No problem, our next Q&amp;amp;A will happen on Saturday, June 10 at 6 PM UTC. If you won’t be able to catch us live, be sure to get your questions in beforehand in the comment section down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this time, make sure to catch the next one. If you want to discuss this post, you can do that on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;UBports forums&lt;/a&gt; or in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/telegram&quot;&gt;Telegram supergroup&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an IRC channel at #ubports on Freenode.

&lt;p&gt;A little late, but here’s the summary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/s-_L3J6EvgY&quot;&gt;our latest Q&amp;amp;A session&lt;/a&gt;. Some facts from the video are already outdated, so read on for a slightly edited summary. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-huge-thank-you-to-our-patrons&quot;&gt;A huge Thank You to our patrons!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thanks to everyone who supports us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/ubports&quot;&gt;patreon&lt;/a&gt;. We currently have 105 supporters donating a total of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$1,103&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;! Your continuous support keeps Ubuntu Touch alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-been-happening&quot;&gt;What’s been happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some cool new people joined our marketing team, providing valuable feedback on how to grow the project more efficiently. As a first step, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/ubports&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; to keep the community in the loop. Be sure to subscribe!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian Douglass implemented &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bhdouglass.com/openstore/web/2017/05/02/the-openstore-upgrade.html&quot;&gt;some amazing new features&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bhdouglass.com/openstore/ubuntu-touch/2017/05/11/the-openstore-app-upgrade.html&quot;&gt;OpenStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bhdouglass.com/openstore/web/2017/05/15/openstore-improvements.html&quot;&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. If you have the OpenStore app installed on your device, it can just update itself. If not, it might be a good idea to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstore.ubports.com/docs&quot;&gt;install it&lt;/a&gt;, since all the cool kids are using it and you don’t want to be the one person without the OpenStore. That would be weird, wouldn’t it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_ooAoZcGei8&quot;&gt;uNav&lt;/a&gt; is back! After seeing the amazing community interest in Ubuntu Touch, Marcos Costales decided to bring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstore.ubports.com/app/navigator.costales&quot;&gt;back to the OpenStore!&lt;/a&gt;. Give him a high-five, everybody!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com&quot;&gt;ubports.com&lt;/a&gt; is now pretty! Please give us your thoughts on the new design.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a similar vein, &lt;a href=&quot;https://devices.ubports.com&quot;&gt;our devices website&lt;/a&gt; is also pretty!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are looking for testers of our new legacy images on all UBports and official Canonical devices. Please note that these are in alpha state and installing them will wipe your device. If you want to help with that, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/How-to-flash-existing-ubuntu-touch-devices-with-Ubports-images&quot;&gt;this wiki page&lt;/a&gt; and be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/UBports-Bug-Trackers&quot;&gt;report all the bugs&lt;/a&gt; you find. Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://ci.ubports.com/&quot;&gt;build chain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://system-image.ubports.com/&quot;&gt;system-image server&lt;/a&gt; are fully operational.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All Ubuntu Touch core apps have been forked into GitHub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstore.ubports.com/app/com.ubuntu.telegram&quot;&gt;The telegram app&lt;/a&gt; has already recieved some love from Florian, and it now supports secret chats and voice messages. Supergroups will be supported soon, but there are still some blockers to be fixed before that can be released. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/225/core-apps-forked-on-github&quot;&gt;If you want to help us&lt;/a&gt; with core apps and maybe even pick their further development, we would be really thankful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-lets-take-on-some-questions&quot;&gt;Now let’s take on some questions!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-we-going-to-use-snaps&quot;&gt;Are we going to use snaps?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to use snaps in our yet-to-come non-legacy branch. We can’t decide yet if it will be the only form of delivering packages to the next generation of Ubuntu Touch, but we definitely want it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-arent-the-legacy-devices-listed-on-devicesubportscom-yet&quot;&gt;Why aren’t the legacy devices listed on &lt;a href=&quot;devices.ubports.com&quot;&gt;devices.ubports.com&lt;/a&gt; yet?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the images are not completely tested, we did not update the page yet. This should happen within a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-there-be-support-for-the-nexus-4&quot;&gt;Will there be support for the Nexus 4?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we have a developer willing to take it on! Since it doesn’t have blazing fast hardware, probably only on the legacy branch, though…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-will-there-be-new-ports&quot;&gt;When will there be new ports?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://halium.org&quot;&gt;Halium&lt;/a&gt;, a common base for multiple alternative linux-based mobile operating systems. As soon as that’s done, we will think about new ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-status-of-anbox&quot;&gt;What’s the status of Anbox?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s under heavy development on the desktop, but we have higher priories right now. If you want to discuss Anbox, you can join their &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/anbox&quot;&gt;telegram group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-aethercastmiracast-so-bad-you-should-fix-that&quot;&gt;Why is Aethercast/Miracast so bad? You should fix that!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one. It is yet to be decided if there will be further development on this. It’s not a very good replacement for an HDMI connection due to massive input lag. Input and help from the community is very much appreciated here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-future-of-app-dev-on-ubuntu-touch-are-we-sticking-with-qml&quot;&gt;What’s the future of app-dev on Ubuntu Touch? Are we sticking with QML?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tricky one. For now, yes. You heard us talking about limited time and resources, right? That’s the reason. We are &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/170/a-vision-of-where-to-go-after-ubuntu-touch-s-death&quot;&gt;evaluating different options for the future of app development and design&lt;/a&gt;, but this is nowhere near to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-you-doing-to-make-sure-that-no-malware-gets-into-the-openstore&quot;&gt;What are you doing to make sure that no malware gets into the OpenStore?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much, at the moment, to be honest. We are not as big of a platform for hackers to target us, but we will have to work on that. Feel free to send your pull-requests to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UbuntuOpenStore&quot;&gt;the OpenStore GitHub Page&lt;/a&gt; to help us improving security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-you-going-to-improve-bluetooth-heaset-support-on-ubuntu-touch&quot;&gt;Are you going to improve Bluetooth Heaset support on Ubuntu Touch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be too hard to fix, since the bluetooth-stack does most of the support, but it’s not very high on our todo list. As always, we’re happy to merge any pull-requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-halium-fix-all-the-hardware-enablement-bugs&quot;&gt;Will Halium fix all the hardware enablement bugs?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Not immediately, of course, but we will get there. First of all, as soon as Halium is released, there is some work required to make Ubuntu Touch work perfectly fine with it. Then, Halium needs to be ported to the specific target device. This is not necessarily less work than porting an operating system to a device directly, but since Halium is supported by multiple projects, there is a much larger crowd to collaborate on the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-halium-create-compatibility-with-apps-for-other-operating-systems&quot;&gt;Does Halium create compatibility with apps for other operating systems?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that’s not what halium is. It’s just a standardized way of making android drivers usable from within other mobile operating systems. We also want to collaborate with other projects on app-dev, but that remains a thing for the future. Baby steps. We will get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-happening-with-convergence&quot;&gt;What’s happening with convergence?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergence is awesome! We want it. It’s our selling point, and we would like to embrace it in the next generation of Ubuntu Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;please-elaborate-on-what-the-1604-image-will-be&quot;&gt;Please elaborate on what the 16.04 image will be.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s going to be based on Ubuntu 16.04 (suprise!), which is very important for us, since we can still benefit from Canonica’ls support that way. The legacy images are still based on Ubuntu 15.04, so we would have to do a lot security maintanence if we’re stuck with it. There will be Snaps, Halium, and Systemd. Other than that, no decisions have been made yet. It mostly depends on what the community wants to see (and what’s feasible)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;we-need-your-feedback&quot;&gt;We need your feedback!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to hear your opinion on what you want the next generation of Ubuntu Touch to be. Obviously we can’t be everybody’s darling, but since UBports is a community-funded project, we need to know your whishes for the future of the operating system. Please use &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com/topic/229/what-is-your-main-points-for-a-perfect-personal-phone-operative-system&quot;&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt; for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have questions that haven’t been answered yet? No problem, our next Q&amp;amp;A will happen on Saturday, May 27 at 6 PM UTC. If you won’t be able to catch us live, be sure to get your questions in beforehand in the comment section down below or &lt;a href=&quot;forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;the forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this time, make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=517OFPd_VTI&quot;&gt;catch the next one&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to discuss this or tell us how stupid we are, you can do that on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;UBports forums&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/telegram&quot;&gt;our Telegram supergroup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care and have a good one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dalton and Jan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UBports Community Q&amp;A: April 29, 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UvfeCj6SRGg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://devblog.ubports.com/assets/2017/04/29-dalton.png&quot; alt=&quot;livestream&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fortnight, another Q&amp;amp;A session! Watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UvfeCj6SRGg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or read on for a quick summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-been-happening&quot;&gt;What’s been happening?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, a big thank you to all our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/ubports/posts&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; supporters. We are currently recieving just over 600$ in donations every month, so this helps a lot in making UBports sustainable. A big high five for that!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://halium.org/&quot;&gt;Halium&lt;/a&gt; is in the air! We joined forces with the Plasma Mobile and Sailfish OS community to create a common base for non-android Linux-based mobile operating systems. We will basically create a unified way of implementing Libhybris, a library that allows us to directly address the Android hardware abstraction layer (HAL). That way, the future of porting will be making Halium work on a device and then just installing any mobile operating system that works with it. A prototype on the Nexus 5 is in the works right now, and it’s gonna be &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;! Bright future ahead, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development team has been working towards building a custom Ubuntu 16.04 rootfs. To make that possible, we now have two extra ARM-servers to speed up compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are aware that the community wants to see an official roadmap. That is already in the works and will be published soon.For now, you can go stalk us on on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/ubports&quot;&gt;trello boards&lt;/a&gt;, even though some project management resources still need to be moved there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new website is in the works! Look out for that next week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have some further insights into Canonical’s plans: The official devices will receive security-updates until the end of June 2017 (We will of course release new images before that) and the click store will stay open until the end of this year. We might even keep it in the images for now, so have a little less pressure to create a seamless transition. We will eventually move all the free and open-source apps to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstore.ubports.com/&quot;&gt;openstore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;call-to-arms&quot;&gt;Call to ARMs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, pun intended. No, I am not sorry. We know that the community is eager to help us and we apologize that we don’t have the resources to enable you to do that. But we actually have a few things that we can use your help with right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a decent &lt;strong&gt;build management tool&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re looking for a tool that hooks into our system image server and let’s us promote builds from our development channel to the slower-moving channels. There is no requirement on language for this, though Marius might kill us if we accept PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know &lt;strong&gt;Groovy&lt;/strong&gt; and have some experience writing plugins for &lt;strong&gt;Jenkins&lt;/strong&gt;, please get in touch with us! We are looking for a way to automate taking on new devices. Your program will need to check a GitHub repository for files and take build instructions from them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re a &lt;strong&gt;web designer&lt;/strong&gt; and you know &lt;strong&gt;NodeJS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pug&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt;? Awesome! Care to look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ubports/ubports.com/tree/mariogrip/new-design&quot;&gt;website redesign&lt;/a&gt;? Just make it look good, that’s all we ask for. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help, now let’s answer some questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qa&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-going-on-with-the-station-dock&quot;&gt;What’s going on with the Station Dock?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Ubucon Europe last year, we announced a nifty little device called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubports.com/2016/11/22/new-shiny.html&quot;&gt;Station Dock&lt;/a&gt;, a Raspberry Pi based gadget that helps with convergence on devices that don’t have wired HDMI out. While there is a working prototype and everything would be ready to go, managing a Crowd-funding campaign and building hardware is a lot of work and we are unsure if &lt;em&gt;more work&lt;/em&gt; is what we need right now. We yet have to decide if we want to follow through with the campaign or just open-source the plans and software right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-the-stable-builds-you-said-they-were-going-to-be-published-this-week&quot;&gt;What about the stable builds? You said they were going to be published this week?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that we’ll have to do in the future is tell the community when we are going to be able to meet deadlines like that, and in this case we are not. There are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/UBports-Bug-Trackers&quot;&gt;some bugs we want to fix before release&lt;/a&gt;, so there is a little delay. An unstable stable release would be a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-legacy-mode-and-why-are-the-old-official-canonical-devices-included-in-it&quot;&gt;What is “Legacy Mode,” and why are the old official Canonical devices included in it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older devices will be on life support and the actual work will happen in the non-legacy branch, but we will still provide critical security-updates and merge bug-fixes from the community. This way you will still be able to use your phone with Ubuntu Touch if you own one of the official devices, but the cool and shiny new features will probably only land in the non-legacy branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are putting devices here because we don’t have any other choice. The official devices from BQ and Meizu have closed Android device trees. Because of this, we aren’t able to fix bugs in hardware enablement or add new features dependant on the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-will-i-be-able-to-reflash-my-phone&quot;&gt;When will I be able to reflash my phone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working as fast as we can. Hopefully the new images will be out there in one or two weeks. We managed to get some blockers out the way and are working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-the-nokia-here-agps-service-stay-in-the-builds-for-the-former-official-devices&quot;&gt;Will the Nokia HERE AGPS service stay in the builds for the former official devices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a question mark there due to licensing issues. If we are allowed to keep HERE, it will stay in the builds, if not, we will try to replace it with Mozilla AGPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-take-over-the-existing-bugreports-from-launchpad-or-does-everything-have-to-be-reported-again&quot;&gt;Will you take over the existing bugreports from launchpad or does everything have to be reported again?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t touch that before we have to, because we don’t want to break all the links and we really don’t want to report everything again. Some may be moved in the future, but that’s yet to be decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-will-happen-to-the-application-lifecycle-restrictions-of-ubuntu-touch&quot;&gt;What will happen to the application lifecycle restrictions of Ubuntu Touch?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to decide that yet, once there are new images, we will think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-host-the-ubuntu-touch-documentation-on-you-own-wiki-or-will-that-stay-where-it-is-right-now&quot;&gt;Will you host the Ubuntu Touch documentation on you own wiki or will that stay where it is right now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now it will stay in the Ubuntu Wiki, and if we’re not forced to move it we won’t. This may change in the future, though. Limited resources, you all know the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-support-multirom&quot;&gt;Will you support MultiROM?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not. We haven’t played with MultiROM in over a year and it would be too much work to fix it right now, so if you have MultiROM and you want Ubuntu Touch, you will have to choose one OS. That ¡*&lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;*! change with Halium, but that’s not carved in stone yet and we won’t make any promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have questions that have not been answered yet? No problem, our next Q&amp;amp;A will happen on Saturday, May 13 at 6 PM UTC. If you won’t be able to catch us live, be sure to get your questions in beforehand in the comment section down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this time, make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-_L3J6EvgY&quot;&gt;catch the next one&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to discuss this or tell us how stupid we are, you can do that on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;UBports forums&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/telegram&quot;&gt;our Telegram supergroup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care and have a good one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Jan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Resolution to Agree On</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a response to the recent open letter sent to the UBports project leadership as well as the response to it. So, in a way, it’s a response-response. A meta response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-egg-is-on-our-face&quot;&gt;The egg is on our face.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, “We” refers to the writers of the open letter. In later sections it will refer to the UBports team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to apologize for the way the original complaints were sent. What came after clicking the “Publish” button was a blowback more extreme than any of the signers expected, but we were the ones who clicked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utlimately, the reasoning behind the letter was to bring the project together more. That might sound counterintuitive, but conflict management isn’t our strong suit. In the end, the letter has suited its purpose, but not without cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry to Marius Gripsgard for the personal stress and hardship caused. We’re sorry to everyone that was confused or scared by the letter and what it might have meant for the project. The whole team here has learned a lot about each other in the past few days. In some cases, more than we would have liked. This will make us stronger in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that we will never handle our gripes like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-now&quot;&gt;What happens now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 25, 2017, two signers of the open letter and Marius Gripsgard met to discuss the letter and the methods of sending it. We reached a lot of agreements and found the places where communication broke down leading to the fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-project-image-is-now-a-concern&quot;&gt;Our project image is now a concern.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t start acting more professional, we aren’t going to get any professional developers on board. This is an obvious problem that mostly points to the UBports team and not the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topic of discussion that came up quickly was our habit of announcing projects or showing off screenshots of things that don’t really work yet, then not following up on them. When this happens in the future, we’ll be sure to specify the nature of these projects better: whether they are official from the project or simply a developer’s toy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be moderating our chat rooms and forum a bit better starting now, trying to keep the discourse professional yet community-oriented. What does that mean for you? Almost nothing. We are okay with light banter and respectful disagreement in UBports communication. We are not okay with communication that becomes rude, insulting, or blatantly off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-team-of-people-to-make-the-decisions-not-one-person&quot;&gt;A team of people to make the decisions, not one person.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers have the power. Decisions that are minor to the user, such as how we decide to implement a display server, will be discussed among the developers. However, decisions that change our users’ phones appearance or function will be discussed more openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, we have agreed to not make snap decisions from only one person. The developer team must agree when it is going to take on a project. The developer team will then communicate this with the Community team or the community directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we have a better solution to ensure proper decision making and project governance. We’ll announce it when it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-sense-of-community-a-listening-atmosphere-between-developers-teams-and-the-people-who-support-us&quot;&gt;A sense of community, a listening atmosphere between developers, teams, and the people who support us.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biweekly Q&amp;amp;A sessions are still happening. At the beginning of these, we will recap what different teams have been doing since the last Q&amp;amp;A. After that, we will launch into the community’s questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, we will improve our communication so this situation won’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-project-roadmap-that-we-follow&quot;&gt;A project roadmap that we follow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of kanban boards and Launchpad blueprints, we will create a list of short-term and long-term goals to achieve. We will include the information that people can use to contribute to these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stick-to-these-changes-for-more-than-a-week&quot;&gt;Stick to these changes for more than a week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell on this one. We’re confident in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things-that-we-learned&quot;&gt;Other things that we learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are interesting snippets that were written in the meeting notes. They have no bearing on the rest of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a discussion about hit-by-a-bus syndrome, we learned that, “Buses come in many forms.” -Jan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we somehow got onto a discussion of cats and aircraft, Marius proudly proclaimed that, “If I was a cat on a plane, I would die from stress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also learned that we should display a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PHP WARNING!&lt;/code&gt; before talking about that language, otherwise Marius might explode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that last section didn’t make it obvious enough, we all had a good time talking to each other after the initial awkwardness passed. A lot of the issues that we faced stemmed from communication breakdowns between project leadership and community members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the best mobile OS that we can. We aren’t letting a little disagreement stop us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UBports Community Q&amp;A: April 15, 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://devblog.ubports.com/assets/2017/04/15-marius.png&quot; alt=&quot;supercoolquestions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marked another Q&amp;amp;A session in the books. You can find it right over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNKxMiAnO1I&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on our shiny new Youtube channel! The following are the majority of asked questions and a summary of their answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to discuss, you can come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/telegram&quot;&gt;our Telegram group&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.ubports.com&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, or you can post a comment using the below Disqus embed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your support! Without further ado, here’s the summary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-you-support-old-official-devices&quot;&gt;Will you support old official devices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. All devices but the Pro 5 and M10 will be in “legacy” mode, getting critical bugfixes and security updates. These will be in-between due to their closed Android source tree.
We have mirrored the system-image-server so we can host the old images at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-will-the-official-devices-be-updated&quot;&gt;How will the official devices be updated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will probably require a reflash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-device-should-i-buy&quot;&gt;Which device should I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should probably buy one of the stable devices: Nexus 5, Fairphone 2, or Oneplus One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-will-there-be-new-ports&quot;&gt;When will there be new ports?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the infrastructure in place to service new devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-to-the-core-apps&quot;&gt;What happens to the core apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving them to GitHub. After our build infrastructure works, we’ll work on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-you-do-with-the-ubuntu-store&quot;&gt;What will you do with the Ubuntu store?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re forking the OpenStore at openstore.ubports.com. We will ask app developers if they would like to place their apps on this store. Otherwise we cannot move the apps. They can be forked and placed on our new&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-you-do-with-ubuntu-one-services-and-push-notifications&quot;&gt;What will you do with Ubuntu One services and push notifications?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might use Ubuntu One sign-in services. Push notifications are going to be handled by applications rather than our servers. We don’t want that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-the-future-hold-for-the-sdk&quot;&gt;What does the future hold for the SDK?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a decision on that is on our todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-we-still-want-to-make-mir-run-on-top-of-wayland-if-canonical-is-going-to-keep-working-on-mir&quot;&gt;Do we still want to make Mir run on top of Wayland, if Canonical is going to keep working on Mir?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical is still maintaining Mir for IoT applications like digital signage. We expect that this means that the desktop and mobile focus will be lost. We still want to run Mir on top of Wayland to give ourselves and Yunit more options in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-plan-for-sync-services&quot;&gt;What is the plan for sync services?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to have sync services, but we need to have more boxes checked before we can worry about that part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-anbox-fit-into-your-plans&quot;&gt;Does Anbox fit into your plans?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bet! Anbox works on the Oneplus One already, it will come to devices that can support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-anbox-send-notifications-through-the-ubuntu-system&quot;&gt;Will Anbox send notifications through the Ubuntu system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a lot we need to fix related to the system and notifications. It’s something we would like to tackle but this is a long term fix, it wont be in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-you-ship-the-google-play-services-with-anbox&quot;&gt;Will you ship the Google Play Services with Anbox?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we are not legally allowed to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UBports Community Q&amp;A: April 8, 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, April 7th, 2017, we started what will be a long journey into the future. A core team meeting at 1800 UTC was quickly followed by a community Q&amp;amp;A. The Q&amp;amp;A is public for anyone to view. You can view it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVEm4X2ptEk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or continue reading for a list of the Q’s and A’s. Remember that as this is still an early time for our project, almost everything here is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-crashes-and-we-finally-arrived-at-hangouts-on-air&quot;&gt;Two crashes and we finally arrived at Hangouts on Air.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crashing both jitsi.org and talky.io, yesterday’s UBports Q&amp;amp;A started with Mariogrip summing up what happened so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our short-term plan is to keep Unity 8 and Mir as is. We need to learn how to build these projects into system-image-server through automated means. We will also look into running Mir on top of Wayland as a stop-gap during the Yunit (unity8org) transition to qtWayland (if that happens, their community hasn’t decided yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We DO NOT want to be maintaining a display server. By moving to Wayland we get native Libhybris support, meaning we should be able to work directly on the upstream libhybris. Until that is possible, though, we will ensure that our infrastructure can support our OS: We need better updates and some release policy changes: devel (nightly), rc-proposed (weekly), and stable (manual push), details TBD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to support existing devices, but they’ll be in “legacy mode” due to hardware limitations. They’ll get small updates and bugfixes on the current 15.04 base, but will probably not make the jump to 16.04. UBports will also not provide Android base updates, though we haven’t planned these for our current stable devices either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-qa&quot;&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-what-about-the-bq-m10&quot;&gt;Q: What about the bq M10?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Because this device is more powerful and still very usable, we’ll probably make it an “official” device rather than a “legacy” one. This means that it will get whatever new OS we build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-what-about-the-unity-8-desktop-experience&quot;&gt;Q: What about the Unity 8 desktop experience?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We need a desktop experience since that’s the important part of convergence. We won’t develop more on Mir, but Unity 8 must be maintained for the important convergence goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-how-can-i-help-if-i-want-to-do-qa-or-testing&quot;&gt;Q: How can I help if I want to do QA or testing?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Right now we have a Google Form that will lead you through all the testing steps, but we need a better solution. More documentation needed. Just using your device and reporting bugs that you find is a very good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-what-will-happen-to-the-notification-servers-and-the-ubuntu-one-dependant-services&quot;&gt;Q: What will happen to the notification servers and the Ubuntu One dependant services?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We can continue to use OpenID through Canonical (Ubuntu One), but we’ll remove the server components from the OS since we want to redefine the notification service. The notification service is FAR too closed for our liking right now. We’re going to focus on usability rather than confinement since we’re breaking the current security model anyway. Using old Android kernels is the worst security flaw we have and there’s no way we’re going to make that go away soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-wait-so-confinement-is-going-away&quot;&gt;Q: Wait, so confinement is going away?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: No, but we’re going to make the system more open and usable rather than locked down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-why-arent-we-collaborating-with-yunit&quot;&gt;Q: Why aren’t we collaborating with &lt;a href=&quot;https://yunit.io&quot;&gt;Yunit&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We are having conversations with them. They want more desktop focus while we have more mobile focus. Both projects benefit from the other’s work. Having two forks of Unity 8 makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-collaborate-with-mer-or-plasma-mobile&quot;&gt;Q: Will we collaborate with Mer or Plasma Mobile?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It’s still on the table. It makes sense for all of us to work together on a common Android base and build our own distributions on top of that. Our communities could all work together and a single device enablement would open it up to lots of new OS’s. Working together means more success for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-youve-split-ubports-contributors-into-teams-whats-the-goal-of-this&quot;&gt;Q: You’ve split UBports contributors into teams. What’s the goal of this?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: A more structured project means that we all have a say and all have a defined purpose. Having different teams means that a team can make a decision faster than if we needed every contributor to agree. We also split into multiple group chats so we can actually talk to each other without being buried.
We have the infrastructure, developer, communication, and QA teams. We’re looking at adding more. Also, the communication team is the best team and no one can say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-the-open-store-continue&quot;&gt;Q: Will the Open Store continue?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: TODO. We’re going to either fork the store or maintain it since it’s shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-how-will-you-finance-all-of-this&quot;&gt;Q: How will you finance all of this?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/get-involved&quot;&gt;Donations&lt;/a&gt;. One-time Paypal donations and Patreon contributions are what will keep us going. Servers are going to be extremely expensive, devices aren’t getting cheaper either. Each member of the QA team will need most of our devices to test. We’re not worrying yet, but this will become a problem in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-can-we-hire-full-time-people&quot;&gt;Q: Can we hire full-time people?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It’s in the future, but we would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to. It would make the project move much faster. A developer and a sysadmin allowing the developers to focus only on developing would be perfect. We don’t have the money for that yet. Or the legal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-sell-devices-pre-installed-with-your-os&quot;&gt;Q: Will we sell devices pre-installed with your OS?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: That’s tricky. Legal issues like Qualcomm licensing would absolutely kill that business… unless we ship the device without modifying any of the proprietary blobs. Long story short, that’s out of our scope right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-what-happened-to-the-station-dock&quot;&gt;Q: What happened to the Station Dock?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It still exists. It’s been postponed for an indefinite amount of time. It’s based on a Raspberry Pi so we might just release the firmware and call it a day… 
inb4 a Chinese company takes the software and ships it as closed-source, making a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-are-we-following-canonicals-plan-or-making-our-own-os&quot;&gt;Q: Are we following Canonical’s plan or making our own OS?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We’re following for now, but we may change direction quickly as we determine what went right and wrong with Ubuntu Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-make-sailfish-os-apps-compatible-with-your-stuff&quot;&gt;Q: Will we make Sailfish OS apps compatible with your stuff?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Maybe? We’ll have very different design languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-support-snaps&quot;&gt;Q: Will we support snaps?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, but legacy devices might not. We don’t think we’ll do the atomic system updates (Ubuntu Core), only apps. We have no idea how atomic updates would work with the Android ecosystem… our guess is that they probably wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-fix-long-standing-critical-bugs-in-ubuntu-touch&quot;&gt;Q: Will we fix long-standing critical bugs in Ubuntu Touch?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We’ll try to polish the OS as much as we can, But don’t expect OTA-16 anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-this-be-hard-without-canonical&quot;&gt;Q: Will this be hard without Canonical?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Yes and no. Since this has now become a community project, we’ve seen a lot less pushback and a lot of people stepping up to help. When Canonical was the only one developing Unity, people hated it. Now people are coming out of the woodwork to say that they loved where it was going and will miss it. We have seen around 400 new devices hitting our system image server since the news. There’s a strange effect that Canonical has on the Open Source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-there-be-a-guide-for-porting-ubuntu-touch-on-the-ubports-website&quot;&gt;Q: Will there be a guide for porting Ubuntu Touch on the UBports website?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-but-how-do-we-really-feel-about-unity-and-touch-being-dropped&quot;&gt;Q: But how do we really &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about Unity and Touch being dropped?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We understand that the project wasn’t making money and that Canonical as a company should make money. We really can’t argue with the decision and Canonical has given us no reason to harbor any ill will (We got to present at MWC! How cool is that!?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-be-using-stuff-from-firefox-os&quot;&gt;Q: Will we be using stuff from Firefox OS?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We stole some of their AGPS stuff, if that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-keep-the-name&quot;&gt;Q: Will we keep the name?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Hard to say. No reason to change it yet, but once we further separate ourselves from Canonical we’ll probably change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-continue-the-core-apps&quot;&gt;Q: Will we continue the core apps?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, but in a feature freeze state unless the community is very willing to help. We need to sort out the bottom of the stack before we work on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-can-we-mirror-the-core-apps-to-github-and-use-git-rather-than-bazaar&quot;&gt;Q: Can we mirror the core apps to GitHub (and use Git rather than Bazaar)?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Sure. Code hosting at GitHub is a bit more accessible than Launchpad so we totally understand where this question came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-keep-using-launchpad&quot;&gt;Q: Will we keep using Launchpad?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Yes. The project management of Launchpad is more than a Kanban board. We like the bugs.launchpad.net more than Github’s issue tracker, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-will-we-consider-moving-to-gitlab&quot;&gt;Q: Will we consider moving to GitLab?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: If we wanted to use it for Git only, sure. But we don’t. So no. GitHub is simply a more accessible platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-are-we-coming-to-ubucon-europe&quot;&gt;Q: Are we coming to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubucon.paris&quot;&gt;Ubucon Europe&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: YES! We’re going to be showing off all of our work that hasn’t happened yet! Go future us! WOOOOOH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-snap-only-supports-kernel-310-and-above-how-will-you-support-older-phones&quot;&gt;Q: Snap only supports kernel 3.10 and above. How will you support older phones?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Backports and patches. Canonical has already started on this. (Dalton’s note: Snaps work on kernel 3.4 with a namespacing patch, they just don’t have confinement). Any newer devices that we port to will have kernel 3.10 or above anyway, so we’re not that concerned. We have a LOT to handle before we even consider this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-are-there-more-updates-coming-to-the-current-ubports-devices&quot;&gt;Q: Are there more updates coming to the current UBports devices?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Yes. We are still focusing on our efforts to bring our stable devices to a good state with the Canonical Ubuntu Touch images. We’ve set the Stable release target for April 30th, but we might not hit that any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;q-what-if-i-missed-the-qa-but-i-want-to-talk-to--yell-at-you&quot;&gt;Q: What if I missed the Q&amp;amp;A but I want to talk to / yell at you?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: You can get a hold of us in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/telegram&quot;&gt;our Telegram supergroup&lt;/a&gt;. We also have a neat little Disqus embed that you can use on all of our blog posts! We’ll be holding more of these community Q&amp;amp;A’s in the future. Our next one should be in about two or three weeks, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dalton and Jan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UBports Developer's Meeting - March 29, 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://devblog.ubports.com/assets/2017/03/30-conferencecall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;conferencecall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday some users and developers from UBports got together online to discuss the project’s present and future goals. There was fun discussion, everyone’s drinks of choice (for all members for which it was legal), and plenty of cats in the webcam frame. We spent some time on a few topics that should be interesting to the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;device-status&quot;&gt;Device Status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus right now is on our three stable devices: The FairPhone 2, Oneplus One, and Nexus 5. We’re putting our efforts toward bringing these devices back to a fully working state. After that’s finished (which it is, mostly), we will push an image to the Stable channel. Gone will be the days where development channels are more functional and less buggy than stable! Prepare thy phone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oneplus-one&quot;&gt;Oneplus One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have too much to say about this one. The developers working on this device have been pretty quiet in the UBports Telegram chat, so I haven’t heard about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nexus-5&quot;&gt;Nexus 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few dedicated community members ensured that the Nexus 5 is ready for prime time once again. We’re going to push a new build to Stable for this device very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fairphone-2&quot;&gt;FairPhone 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same story as the Nexus 5, but with a much larger community. Thanks to the support of Smoose (a Netherlandic technology company), we were able to bring this device to a stable state in record time. In this process, we fixed quite a few blocking bugs for the Oneplus One and Nexus 5. A shared base means something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;near-future-goals&quot;&gt;Near Future Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bug-reporting&quot;&gt;Bug Reporting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a sticking point for users and developers alike. We’ve decided that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; bug tracking for UBports devices will take place on Launchpad. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubports.com/get-involved&quot;&gt;Get Involved&lt;/a&gt; page for more information. Feel free to report bugs in UBports websites in their GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;polish&quot;&gt;Polish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks will be spent on polishing our stable devices before shipping an image to the Stable channel. After that, we’ll move on to making the websites and wiki nicer. We hope that you’ll love how everything looks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;farther-future-goals&quot;&gt;Farther Future Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These come after the near future goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-base&quot;&gt;New Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that an Android 5.1 (CyanogenMod 12.1) base limits us from porting Ubuntu to new devices. Because of this, we will begin work on a LineageOS 14.1 base. This doesn’t mean that current devices are abandoned, it will simply lay the groundwork for future devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-ubuntu&quot;&gt;New Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 15.04 is almost entirely abandoned. Full stop. The only updates that Canonical has promised are for security. We need to move on from 15.04 as soon as possible. The 16.04 Touch images seem like a good place to jump, even though they aren’t currently functional. This will give us a platform that’s able to run Snaps &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Clicks, allowing us to move on to Ubuntu Personal when it comes around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided that, if possible, the FP2 will be our Ubuntu 16.04 testing device. We need to get snapd running on it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-device&quot;&gt;New Device&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where we had the least success. Our dream device for porting Ubuntu and showing it off meets a few requirements: it has MHL, Slimport, or a dedicated HDMI port; it is available in the US as well as the rest of the world (official Ubuntu devices got the second part right); and it is powerful enough to make convergence shine. The Galaxy S8 announcement came at the perfect time, we’re just interested in how friendly Samsung will be to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions for this miracle device, we’re all ears in our Telegram group (you can grab the link from the MOTD of #ubports on Freenode for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be removing the devel_rc-proposed channel soon. Four channels is a ridiculous amount for a project of our size. System-image-server has the ability to redirect a device to another channel without user intervention, so there’s nothing you’ll need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Even though https://stats.ubports.com/ can’t be guaranteed to be accurate, it is still an impressive look at the dynamics of our project. With just a small team of developers and a hefty amount of word of mouth, we’ve gotten really far. Thank you for your support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Ubuntu Touch Dead?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With news that dawned recently we’re expecting an influx of people joining our IRC to ask if we’re going to quit porting Ubuntu Touch now that it’s been announced to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s not dead. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Ubuntu-Phone-Snap-Hold&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; over at Phoronix for a better look at the issue. Basically, Ubuntu Touch is just going to be rolled into Ubuntu Personal, the Snap-based version of Ubuntu. We’re going to start working on this as we have time, but it’s very experimental right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canonical is trying to focus their resources on Snaps, Unity 8, and Mir. We understand this and are not at all upset. It will bring the project forward as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, you guys should check out the Ubuntu Touch bountysource. You can find our tracker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bountysource.com/trackers/45573416-ubports-android&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There isn’t much there yet, but I for one find merit in having it around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the FP2 community, we also have a video showing our ability to place a call from a FP2 over GSM! Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz43mNw4AtU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it for today. Ubuntu Touch is not dead. Come get in touch with us at #ubports on Freenode or the forum if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;
